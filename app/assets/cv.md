Experienced polyglot engineer with a huge breadth and depth of knowledge and understanding, working in multiple languages across a wide range of commercial frontend, backend, devops, and embedded contexts. Lives for problem solving and optimising, and thrives in the challenges of the London tech startup scene.

Communicating complex technical solutions to stakeholders and fellow engineers in a way they can relate to is key to my approach—if people can't understand what's happening, the most appropriate solution is unlikely to be reached.

Passionate about having reproducible infrastructure using CI/CD and IaC (GitOps).

As a natural creative, what drives me is a job where I wake up every day and build something interesting.

## Who is James?

I don't see programming and computers as simply a job, but part of who I am. I think the world is going through very interesting times and it will be passionate programmers and thinkers that will play an important part in shaping it. My current hobbies are photography (events, portrait, street, travel), and I'm an avid cyclist (mainly fixed, but also gravel). When I lived in Brighton I often helped out with putting on shows and DJing club nights. I enjoy going out with friends and finding new bands or other weird and wonderful things to do. I am a keen follower of current affairs, especially from a technical standpoint, and think a lot about the world and am interested by new developments politically and scientifically.
